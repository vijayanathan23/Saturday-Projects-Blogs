Quickly to see through what are Interceptors - to monitor and understand how two or more computers interact, cyber security professionals intercept the network communication.  
This happens mainly at **application** and **network layers**.

## Application Layer Interception
At the **Application layer**, it is mainly used to test/understand **HTTP/HTTPS** protocols or even **socket communication**.  
There are many tools to do this, including **Burp Suite** and **ZAP**, which are the most popular ones.

## Network Layer Interception
At the **Network layer**, the most well-known tool is **Wireshark**, a packet sniffer that captures and analyzes network traffic.  
However, other tools such as **tcpdump** (a command-line network packet analyzer) and **MITMproxy** (a tool for intercepting and modifying HTTP/HTTPS traffic) can also be used.  
If you're focusing on **web traffic interception**, **MITMproxy** could be worth exploring.

## This Saturday's Exploration
Now, as this Saturday's exploration plan is to understand how **Web Application Interception** works and maybe build a small one?  
(Well, we have a lot of **LLMs ü§ñ** for help‚Ä¶ just for help!)

Having used **Burp Suite** (a tool used for request interception) a few years back, I am familiar with the **Proxy server concept**.

## Interceptors vs. Proxies: What's the Difference?
A **proxy server** acts as an intermediary that forwards requests and responses between a client (browser) and a server.  
Proxies can serve various purposes, including **caching, security, filtering, and anonymity**‚Äînot just interception.  

On the other hand, an **interceptor** is a specialized proxy that focuses on **monitoring and analyzing** network traffic.  
It captures, logs, and sometimes modifies requests and responses.  

Popular **interceptor tools** like **Burp Suite** and **ZAP** are essentially **proxies with logging and manipulation capabilities**, designed specifically for **testing and security analysis**.

For a little better explanation of proxies, check this out:

## Designing an HTTP/HTTPS Interceptor
With this understanding of **proxy servers**, I tried to quickly design an **HTTP/HTTPS interceptor**.  
By default, this is going to be **local**, so the **endpoint IP** will be `127.0.0.1`.

### Basic Plan
1. The **HTTP interceptor** will listen on **port 8080**.
2. **Port 8080** will be configured in **Firefox as a proxy server**, forwarding all browser requests to the interceptor.
3. The **HTTP Interceptor** should **capture requests** from the client and **cache them**.
4. The **HTTP Interceptor** should **forward the request** and **cache the response** from the server.
5. The **intercepted data** should be displayed to the user.

By just explaining what I'm trying to build, I kinda created **software requirements** üòÖ.

## High-Level Design
The above image represents the **high-level design** and plan for the interceptor.  
At this point, I realized I wouldn‚Äôt be able to **intercept HTTPS requests** because that would mean handling **TLS/SSL encryption/decryption**.  
(This will be explored in one of the upcoming Saturdays!)

## Building the Interceptor in Golang
I always wanted to explore **Golang**, so I decided to build this interceptor in Go.

```go
func HandleHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, interceptedData *[]map[string]string, mu *sync.Mutex) {
    // Read the entire request body
    body, _ := io.ReadAll(r.Body)
    r.Body.Close() // Close the request body to free resources

    // Bypass Firefox captive portal detection by responding with "204 No Content"
    if r.URL.Host == "detectportal.firefox.com" {
        w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNoContent)
        return
    }

    // Store request details in a map
    requestData := map[string]string{
        "method": r.Method,      // HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
        "url":    r.URL.String(), // Full request URL
        "body":   string(body),  // Request body as a string
    }

    // Create a new HTTP request using the extracted method, URL, and body
    req, err := http.NewRequest(r.Method, r.URL.String(), bytes.NewReader(body))
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Failed to create request", http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
    }

    // Copy headers from the original request to the new request
    req.Header = r.Header.Clone()

    // Forward the request to the actual destination
    resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err) // Log the error
        http.Error(w, "Failed to forward request", http.StatusBadGateway)
        return
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close() // Ensure the response body is closed to prevent resource leaks

    // Read the response body into a byte slice
    originalRespBody, _ := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)

    // Create a copy of the response body for sending to the browser
    respBodyForBrowser := make([]byte, len(originalRespBody))
    copy(respBodyForBrowser, originalRespBody)

    // Check if the response is gzip-compressed and decompress if necessary
    if resp.Header.Get("Content-Encoding") == "gzip" {
        gzipReader, err := gzip.NewReader(bytes.NewReader(originalRespBody))
        if err != nil {
            http.Error(w, "Failed to decompress response", http.StatusInternalServerError)
            return
        }
        defer gzipReader.Close()
        originalRespBody, _ = io.ReadAll(gzipReader) // Read the decompressed response
    }

    // Extract and print the Content-Type for debugging
    contentType := resp.Header.Get("Content-Type")
    fmt.Println(requestData["url"]) // Print the request URL
    fmt.Println(contentType)        // Print the response content type

    // Dump the response headers for debugging (excluding the body)
    dump, _ := httputil.DumpResponse(resp, false)

    // Store response details in requestData for logging or interception
    requestData["response"] = html.EscapeString(string(originalRespBody)) // Escape HTML to prevent script injection
    requestData["headers"] = string(dump) // Store raw headers

    // Lock the shared data structure before modifying it (to ensure thread safety)
    mu.Lock()
    *interceptedData = append(*interceptedData, requestData) // Save request details
    mu.Unlock()

    // Copy response headers to the client response
    for k, v := range resp.Header {
        for _, val := range v {
            w.Header().Add(k, val)
        }
    }

    // Send the original response status code
    w.WriteHeader(resp.StatusCode)

    // Write the response body to the client without modification
    w.Write(respBodyForBrowser)
}

```

While running, I came across **Firefox's Captive Portal detection**.  
A **captive portal** is used in **hotels, cafes, or public Wi-Fi networks** to **authenticate users** before granting internet access.

## How the Interceptor Works
1. The **client (browser) sends a request** ‚Üí received by the **proxy server (interceptor)**.
2. The **proxy server creates a copy of the request** and forwards it to the **actual server**.
3. The **server sends a response** ‚Üí the **proxy stores it and forwards it back** to the client.

Pretty simple! Well‚Ä¶ it **seemed simple**, but it certainly took some time to understand **Golang** and its libraries.  
There were hiccups‚Äîlike **not realizing the server was encoding responses in Gzip** and spending **half a day** figuring out what encoding was happening! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Building the Viewer
To **view the intercepted data**, I created a **separate HTTP server** running on **port 8081** within the same Golang app.  
This **Data Viewer** server:
- Uses the **intercepted data from the proxy server (8080)**.
- Serves a **vanilla JavaScript UI** that requests data every second.
- Displays the **intercepted requests and responses** dynamically.
